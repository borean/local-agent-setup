# Outline Build

Structured outline for research_article / review / case_report / abstract / preprint. Uses Two-Phase Generator-Evaluator: blind acceptance criteria first, then sighted outline.

## Procedure

1. Validate inputs against the JSON schema in frontmatter
2. (Skill-specific procedure — see references/skill-libraries-survey.md and docs/skillset_v1.md / skillset_v2_additions.md for the full method)
3. Emit structured output per frontmatter `outputs:` schema
4. Append to session ledger via post-tool-audit-jsonl hook

## Failure modes

- Inputs malformed → reject with explicit schema error; do not silent-pass
- Required local cache/index missing → suggest the relevant setup or cron skill
- Model returns ill-formed structured output → retry once with stricter system prompt; if still fails, raise structured error (Karpathy rule #12)

## Example

(To be filled in with a concrete example during first invocation. The frontier-LLM-driven first-run will populate this.)

## Credit

Two-Phase pattern from ARS. Prevents post-hoc rubric softening.
